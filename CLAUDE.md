# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — start the Vite dev server (HMR)
- `npm run build` — type-check (`tsc -b`) then `vite build`. The TypeScript step is part of the build; treat type errors as build failures.
- `npm run lint` — flat-config ESLint over the repo
- `npm run preview` — serve the production build locally
- `npx playwright test` — run the e2e suite (boots Vite via `webServer` in `playwright.config.ts`)
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/landing.spec.ts` — run a single spec
- `npx playwright test --ui` — open the Playwright UI for debugging

## E2E tests

Playwright lives in `tests/`. Structure:
- `tests/e2e/*.spec.ts` — specs grouped by surface (landing, auth, info-pages, home, home-advanced, dashboard)
- `tests/pages/*.page.ts` — Page Object Model wrappers; each route has its own POM
- `playwright.config.ts` — chromium-only, `baseURL` http://localhost:5173, auto-starts the dev server

Protected pages (`/home`, `/dashboard`, `/messages`) are tested with the API mocked via `page.route('**/FeedController/*')`. The `HomePage` POM injects a fake JWT cookie so the route guard lets us in. The Dashboard POM seeds `sessionStorage` with the signup-in-progress flag.

## Environment

Required Vite env vars (read at build/dev time via `import.meta.env`, see `src/api.ts` and `src/supabase.ts`):

- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` — base URL for the Denoisr backend (e.g. `https://denoisr-api.onrender.com`, or `http://127.0.0.1:8000` locally)
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — Supabase project credentials, used by the realtime client

`apiRequest` will throw on `.replace` if `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is missing — make sure `.env` is populated before running.

## Architecture

Single-page React 19 + TypeScript + Vite app deployed to Vercel (`vercel.json` rewrites all paths to `index.html` so client-side routing works on hard refresh).

### Routing & auth gating

`src/App.tsx` defines all routes. Three categories:

- `PublicOnlyRoute` (`/`, `/login`, `/signup`) — redirects authenticated users to `/home`
- `ProtectedRoute` (`/home`, `/dashboard`, `/messages`, `/profile`, `/profile/edit`, `/applications`, `/company`) — redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`
- Unguarded marketing/legal pages (features, about, careers, privacy, etc.)

Both guards live in `src/components/AuthGuard.tsx` and key off `isAuthenticated()` from `src/auth.ts`. A special case: `/dashboard` is accessible mid-signup via the `hasSignupInProgress()` sessionStorage flag, before a real token exists.

### Auth model

The real JWT lives in an **httpOnly** cookie (`denoisr_auth_token`) set by the API (`LoginController` `/login` and `/signup`, see `app/auth_utils.py` in Denoisr-API). Page JS never reads or writes it — `apiRequest` sends it automatically via `credentials: 'include'`. This is deliberate defense-in-depth: an XSS hole can't exfiltrate the session token because it's not reachable from `document.cookie`.

Since JS can't read the real cookie, `src/auth.ts` maintains two plain, non-secret cookies purely for client-side routing/display — spoofing them only fools the UI, never the backend, since every real API call is authorized server-side off the httpOnly cookie:

- `denoisr_session` — a `1`/absent flag; `isAuthenticated()` checks for its presence
- `denoisr_user_id` — the current user's id, set from the `user.id` field in the login/signup response body; read directly by `getAuthenticatedUserId()` (no JWT decoding happens client-side anymore)

Both are set together by `markAuthenticatedFromResponse(response)` (called after a successful `/LoginController/login` or the final `/LoginController/signup` in `DashboardPage.tsx`) and cleared by `clearSession()`, which also fires a best-effort `POST /LoginController/logout` to clear the httpOnly cookie server-side.

Additional utilities in `src/auth.ts`:

- `getStoredFilters` / `setStoredFilters` / `clearStoredFilters` — persist active filter state per mode (`jobs` | `people`) in cookies (`denoisr_filters_jobs`, `denoisr_filters_people`)
- `getStoredProfile` / `setStoredProfile` / `clearStoredProfile` — cache the user's profile in a `denoisr_profile` cookie (same 1-week TTL) to avoid a fetch on every page load
- `fetchAndCacheProfile` — called on every route change (in `App.tsx` `useEffect`) when authenticated; silently updates the profile cookie from `/ProfileController/getProfile`
- `getGlassMode` / `setGlassMode` — reads/writes a `glassMode` boolean persisted inside the `denoisr_profile` cookie; toggles the liquid-glass UI theme

### API layer

`src/api.ts` exposes a single `apiRequest(path, { method, body })` helper that defaults to `POST`, JSON-serializes the body, and sends `credentials: 'include'` so the browser attaches the httpOnly auth cookie automatically. The Denoisr backend uses controller-style paths like `/FeedController/getMessages` (see `MessagesPage.tsx`). When adding new endpoints, go through `apiRequest` so credentials and the base URL stay consistent. The two raw (non-JSON) `fetch` calls for photo upload (`CompanyPage.tsx`, `ProfileEditPage.tsx`) also need `credentials: 'include'` since they bypass `apiRequest`.

Retry behaviour: `apiRequest` retries up to 10 times on 5xx or network errors using exponential backoff (`BASE_DELAY=500ms * 2^attempt + jitter`). 4xx responses are returned immediately without retry.

### Supabase

`src/supabase.ts` exports a single shared `supabase` client. It's used alongside the REST API — primarily for realtime subscriptions on the messages feature, not as the source of truth for auth (auth tokens come from the Denoisr backend, not Supabase Auth).

### Push notifications

`src/notifications.ts` handles Web Push on the client side:

1. `registerServiceWorker()` — registers `public/sw.js`
2. `subscribeToPush()` — fetches the VAPID public key from `/NotificationController/vapidPublicKey`, calls `pushManager.subscribe`, then POSTs the subscription to `/NotificationController/subscribe`

Both are called on every authenticated route change (in `App.tsx`). The service worker at `public/sw.js` handles `push` events and shows the notification.

### Styling — Editorial Mono is authoritative

**Design source of truth:** `.claude/skills/denoisr-design/` (the skill folder). Its `README.md` is the brand spec; `colors_and_type.css` is the token vocabulary. The legacy `design.md` at the repo root is **out of date** and being phased out — it describes an older "pure white / The Future font / magenta + orange" direction that's no longer the brand.

**Before writing or editing any CSS, read `.claude/skills/denoisr-design/engineering-rules.md`.** It codifies the CSS/React pitfalls this codebase has shipped (and caught the hard way): media-query specificity conflicts, mobile-overflow from hardcoded desktop dimensions, the legacy `denoisr.css` override pattern, viewport-test gaps. The file ends with a pre-flight checklist; run it before claiming visual work is done.

**CSS load order (from `src/main.tsx`):**
1. `src/index.css` — minimal resets
2. `src/styles/editorial.css` — global Editorial Mono tokens at `:root`, base type, `.btn` / `.nav` / `.footer` / `.info` / `.auth` styles. Also **aliases the legacy `--d-magenta / --d-orange / --d-dark / --d-lavender / --d-shadow-elev` tokens to editorial equivalents** so older pages inherit the new palette without per-page rewrites.
3. `src/styles/landing.css` — scoped under `.editorial-landing`, only loaded by `ProductPage.tsx`.

**Editorial Mono fundamentals (must obey):**
- Page background is `--paper` (#fbfaf6), never pure white.
- Fonts: `Geist` for sans, `Geist Mono` for eyebrows/numerals/metadata, `Instrument Serif` italic only for accents (pull quotes, occasional `<em>` in titles).
- Wordmark always renders as `Denoisr.` with the period dimmed (`--ink-4`).
- Sentence case everywhere except mono eyebrows (UPPERCASE, +1.4 tracking).
- No emoji, no gradient buttons, no left-border-accent cards, no hand-drawn SVG illustrations.
- Cards = 22–24px radius, warm-tinted layered shadows (never neutral grey).
- Decision colors (`--decision-pass` clay-red, `--decision-like` moss-green) appear **only** on swipe gestures, never on idle UI chrome.

### Pages — migration status

Routes live in `src/pages/`, wired in `src/App.tsx`. On `/` only, App.tsx hides the global `Navbar` and `Footer` so the editorial landing owns its own chrome.

**All pages now migrated to Editorial Mono.** Each has its own scoped stylesheet under `src/styles/` and JSX uses namespaced class prefixes (no longer the old legacy classes from `denoisr.css` which has been removed):

- `ProductPage.tsx` (`/`) — landing. Interactive swipe deck, Jobs/People mode toggle, `vs the feed` comparison, real-cited research, FAQ accordion, inline invite form. Scoped under `.editorial-landing` in `landing.css`. App.tsx hides the global Navbar/Footer here.
- `InfoPage.tsx` — long-form article layout used by 11 marketing/legal/info wrapper pages (About, Careers, Contact, CookiePolicy, Features, ForRecruiters, HelpCenter, HowItWorks, PrivacyPolicy, Security, Status, TermsOfService). Editing a wrapper just changes `label / title / paragraphs`. Styles in `editorial.css` under `.info`.
- `LoginPage.tsx`, `SignupPage.tsx` — editorial auth card with pastel wash, mono labels, pill primary button. Styles in `editorial.css` under `.auth`. `SignupPage` supports a LinkedIn import flow: user pastes their LinkedIn URL → hits `/LoginController/linkedinImport` → backend scrapes via Apify then restructures with Gemini → pre-fills the signup form.
- `ForgotPasswordPage.tsx` (`/forgot-password`, `PublicOnlyRoute`) — email-only form that POSTs to `/LoginController/forgotPassword`. Branches on the response: if it includes a `token` (API has no `RESEND_API_KEY` configured — see Denoisr-API CLAUDE.md), navigates straight to `/reset-password?token=...`, skipping email entirely; otherwise shows the generic "if registered, a reset link is on its way" confirmation, which never reveals whether the email is actually registered. Same `.auth` shell.
- `ResetPasswordPage.tsx` (`/reset-password`, unguarded — deliberately not under `PublicOnlyRoute`/`ProtectedRoute` since it's driven by a one-time token, independent of whatever session state happens to exist in the browser) — reads `?token=` from the URL, posts `{ token, newPassword }` to `/LoginController/resetPassword`, shows the backend's error message verbatim on an invalid/expired token, and redirects to `/login` on success.
- `HomePage.tsx` (`/home`) — 3-column dashboard (filters · deck · preview) per the skill's `ui_kits/web/` spec. Drag-swipe, decision stamps that fade in proportional to drag distance, "It's a fit." match overlay, mobile bottom-nav, mobile chip rail for active filters. Scoped CSS in `home.css`, prefix `hp-`.
- `DashboardPage.tsx` (`/dashboard`) — profile composer with repeatable rows (highlights / tags / proof sections), typeahead suggestions, sticky right rail. Scoped CSS in `dashboard.css`, prefix `dp-`.
- `MessagesPage.tsx` (`/messages`) — 3-col chat (connections · thread · profile context), ⌘+↵ to send, ink-on-paper outbound bubbles vs paper-on-paper inbound, Supabase realtime subscription preserved. Scoped CSS in `messages.css`, prefix `mp-`.
- `ProfilePage.tsx` (`/profile`) — read-only view of the current user's profile. Scoped CSS in `profile.css`.
- `ProfileEditPage.tsx` (`/profile/edit`) — full profile editor (photo, headline, highlights, tags, sections, work experience, projects). Photo upload goes to `/ProfileController/uploadImage` (proxied to ImgBB). Scoped CSS in `profile-edit.css`.
- `JobApplicationsPage.tsx` (`/applications`) — candidate's list of jobs they've swiped right on, with status badges. Fetches from `/FeedController/jobApplications`. Scoped CSS in `job-applications.css`, prefix `jap-`.
- `CompanyPage.tsx` (`/company`) — recruiter-facing dashboard: company profile form, job listing management, applicant review with status pipeline (new → reviewing → shortlisted → messaged → hired / passed). Fetches from `CompanyController` endpoints. Scoped CSS in `company.css`, prefix `cp-`.
- Shared components: `Navbar`, `Footer`, `Button`, `LoadingState` — restyled via `editorial.css`.
- `MobileBottomNav` — rendered inside `App.tsx` for all authenticated app pages; receives an `activePage` prop derived from `pathname`.
- `NotificationBell` (`src/components/ui/NotificationBell.tsx`) — shows unread notification count badge; polls `/NotificationController/unreadCount`.
- `PhotoEditor` (`src/components/ui/PhotoEditor.tsx`) — crop/preview UI for profile photo uploads; used in `ProfileEditPage`. Scoped CSS in `photo-editor.css`.

**`denoisr.css` has been removed** — its 18 in-use classes (`.denoisrApp`, `.denoisrMain`, `.btn` system, `.sectionLabel`, etc.) were merged into `editorial.css`. The ~3300-line legacy file is gone.

### Data layer

Heavy pages own their own data fetching and realtime subscriptions — there is no shared data layer, state manager, or query library. If you add cross-page state, note that the current architecture deliberately avoids global stores.

### Related repos (cloned to parent directory)

- `../Denoisr-API/` — Python backend (FastAPI-style; `app/`, `db.py`, `requirements.txt`). The `VITE_API_BASE_URL` points at this service in production.
- `../Denoisr-DB/` — schema and `DDL/` for the Postgres database the API talks to.

When debugging API responses or adding new endpoints, check `../Denoisr-API/app/` rather than guessing at the schema. The UI's `apiRequest` paths (`/LoginController/login`, `/FeedController/getMessages`) map directly to controllers in that repo.
